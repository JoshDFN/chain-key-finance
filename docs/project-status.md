# Teleport Project Status

This document provides an overview of the current status of the Teleport project, including what has been implemented, what is still in progress, and what needs to be done to make the project fully functional.

## Current Status

### Deployed to Internet Computer Mainnet

The project has been deployed to the Internet Computer mainnet with the following canister IDs:

- **ckBTC**: ktciv-wqaaa-aaaad-aakhq-cai
- **ckETH**: io7g5-fyaaa-aaaad-aakia-cai
- **ckUSDC**: 4oswu-zaaaa-aaaai-q3una-cai
- **DEX**: 44ubn-vqaaa-aaaai-q3uoa-cai
- **Frontend**: zonwa-fiaaa-aaaai-q3uqq-cai
- **ISO Dapp**: 43vhz-yiaaa-aaaai-q3uoq-cai

### Implemented Features

1. **Frontend UI**
   - Complete user interface for the ISO Dapp
   - DEX interface with order book and trading functionality
   - Portfolio view for tracking assets
   - Transaction history tracking

2. **Backend Canisters**
   - ISO Dapp canister with deposit address generation
   - DEX canister with order book functionality
   - Token canisters for ckBTC, ckETH, and ckUSDC

3. **Chain Key Integration**
   - Bitcoin address generation using threshold ECDSA
   - Ethereum address generation using threshold ECDSA
   - Basic deposit monitoring for BTC, ETH, and USDC

### Partially Implemented Features

1. **Blockchain Integration**
   - The code is configured to use mainnet for both Bitcoin and Ethereum
   - Deposit address generation works but uses simplified cryptography
   - Deposit monitoring is implemented but may not handle all edge cases

2. **Transaction Verification**
   - Basic confirmation tracking is implemented
   - Fallback mechanisms exist for when the blockchain API calls fail

3. **Token Minting**
   - Basic minting functionality is implemented
   - Conversion rates are simplified and may need adjustment

## What Needs to Be Done

### 1. Complete Blockchain Integration

- **Implement proper cryptographic functions**
  - Replace simplified SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160 hashing with actual implementations
  - Implement proper Keccak-256 hashing for Ethereum address generation
  - Add proper checksum calculation for Bitcoin addresses

- **Improve error handling**
  - Remove remaining fallback mechanisms that generate simulated data
  - Implement proper retry mechanisms for blockchain API calls
  - Add comprehensive logging for debugging purposes

- **Enhance security**
  - Implement secure key management using HSM or similar technology
  - Add multi-signature support for high-value transactions
  - Implement key rotation policies

### 2. Testing and Verification

- **Develop comprehensive test suite**
  - Unit tests for all components
  - Integration tests for the entire system
  - End-to-end tests with real transactions

- **Conduct security audit**
  - Review code for security vulnerabilities
  - Test for common attack vectors
  - Verify proper access control

### 3. Documentation and Monitoring

- **Complete user documentation**
  - Create user guides for deposit and trading
  - Document API endpoints for developers
  - Provide troubleshooting guides

- **Set up monitoring and alerting**
  - Implement system monitoring for the canisters
  - Set up alerts for critical issues
  - Create dashboards for tracking system performance

## Timeline

| Phase | Description | Estimated Duration |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Complete blockchain integration | 4 weeks |
| 2 | Testing and verification | 2 weeks |
| 3 | Documentation and monitoring | 2 weeks |
| 4 | Final deployment and launch | 1 week |

## Conclusion

The Teleport project has made significant progress with a functional frontend and backend deployed to the Internet Computer mainnet. The core functionality for deposit address generation and monitoring is in place, but several improvements are needed to make the system production-ready.

The most critical areas to address are proper cryptographic implementations, comprehensive error handling, and enhanced security measures. With these improvements, the Teleport platform will be ready for real-world use, enabling secure cross-chain asset management and trading on the Internet Computer.
